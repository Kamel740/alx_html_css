            <h1>EGYPT</h1>
            <h2>Ancient Egypt history </h2>
            <p>Ancient Egypt was one of the world’s first great civilizations, known for its incredible achievements in
                architecture, art, and science. It began around 3100 BCE and lasted for over 3,000 years.</p>

            <h2>Pyramids of Giza</h2>
            <p>The pyramids of Giza are among the most famous monuments in the world. The Great Pyramid of Khufu was
                originally
                146 meters tall and was the tallest human-made structure for over 3,800 years.</p>

            <h2>believes</h2>
            <p>Egyptians believed strongly in the afterlife. That’s why they mummified their dead and buried them with
                food,
                jewelry, and other goods they might need in the next life.</p>

            <h2>writing and reading</h2>
            <p>Hieroglyphics, the writing system of ancient Egypt, combined pictures and symbols to tell stories and
                record
                history. It was used in temples, tombs, and even on jewelry.</p>
